# Creating A Plugin

If one of the [independently maintained plugins](../list.md) doesn't suit your needs, then you can create your own, to achieve maximum customizability.

Most plugins create either new [tile-providers.md](../../layers/tile-layer/tile-providers.md "mention"), or new [layers.md](../../usage/layers.md "mention"). Some plugins just provide additional useful tools.

{% content-ref url="creating-new-tile-providers.md" %}
[creating-new-tile-providers.md](creating-new-tile-providers.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="creating-new-layers.md" %}
[creating-new-layers.md](creating-new-layers.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Submitting A New Plugin

If you've made your own plugin that you're willing to share, please let us know in the #plugins channel on the flutter\_map Discord server. We can then add it to the [list.md](../list.md "mention"). We're always looking forward to see what you've made!

When submitting a plugin, please ensure the plugin:

* _preferably_ includes 'flutter\_map\_' in the name, by convention
* is _preferably_ available via a standard pub.dev package installation
* includes good documentation (at least to setup basic functionality), and a code example
